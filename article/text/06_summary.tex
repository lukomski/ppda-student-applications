The SVM model achieved an accuracy, precision, and recall of 0.64, indicating that it correctly predicts the class labels for 64\% of the data points. The Decision Tree Classifier performed slightly better, with an accuracy, precision, and recall of 0.68, correctly predicting the class labels for 68\% of the data points. The KNN Classifier showed similar performance, with an accuracy, precision, and recall of 0.69, correctly predicting the class labels for 69\% of the data points. These metrics provide insights into the models' ability to classify instances and predict positive class labels.

In summary, the KNN Classifier showed demonstrated the highest performance among the three models. These findings suggest that this classifierr may be the most effective choice for predicting the Dean's decision, considering its higher accuracy, precision and recall values.
