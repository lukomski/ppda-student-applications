The comparative analysis of three ML models for predicting the dean's decision revealed varying levels of performance. The Decision Tree Classifier outperformed the other models, achieving an accuracy of 0.72, precision of 0.73, and recall of 0.73. The SVM model demonstrated moderate performance with an accuracy, precision, and recall of 0.64. The KNN Classifier achieved similar results to the SVM model, with an accuracy, precision, and recall of 0.69. These findings suggest that the Decision Tree Classifier may be the most effective choice for predicting the dean's decision, considering its higher accuracy and precision values.
