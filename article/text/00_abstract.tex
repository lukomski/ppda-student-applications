Accurately predicting the decisions made by the Dean in an academic institution holds immense significance due to its profound impact on students, faculty, and the institution as a whole. This article focuses on conducting a comparative analysis of three distinct machine learning models: Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Tree Classifier, and k-nearest neighbors (KNN). The primary objective is to assess the effectiveness of these models in predicting the Dean's decisions, specifically categorizing them as positive or negative. Through a meticulous examination of each model's performance, strengths, and limitations, this study aims to offer valuable insights that can optimize decision-making processes within academic institutions. The dataset employed in this study has undergone thorough data cleaning and transformation procedures, ensuring the accuracy and relevance of the chosen features.

The best classifier in this case turned out to be KNN with an accuracy of 69\%. The next was Decision Tree with score 68\% of accuracy. The last one was SVM which achieved 64\%.
