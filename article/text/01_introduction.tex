Predicting the decision of the Dean in an academic institution is a task of significant importance, as it can greatly influence the lives of students, faculty, and the overall direction of the institution. This article presents a comparative analysis of three carefully selected ML models - Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Tree Classifier, and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) - to determine their effectiveness in predicting the Dean's decision as either positive or negative. By examining the performance, strengths, and limitations of each model, this study aims to provide valuable insights that can enhance decision-making processes within academic institutions.
