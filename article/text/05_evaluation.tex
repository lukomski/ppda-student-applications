The SVM model demonstrates an accuracy, precision, and recall of 0.64. This implies that it accurately predicts the class labels for 64\% of the data points. When it assigns a positive class, it is correct 64\% of the time, and it successfully identifies 64\% of the instances belonging to the positive class.

In the case of the Decision Tree Classifier, it achieves an accuracy, precision, and recall of 0.68. This signifies that it effectively predicts the class labels for 68\% of the data points. When it assigns a positive class, it is correct 68\% of the time, and it accurately identifies 68\% of the positive class instances.

As for the KNN Classifier, it exhibits an accuracy, precision, and recall of 0.69. This indicates that it correctly predicts the class labels for 69\% of the data points. When it assigns a positive class, it is correct 69\% of the time, and it successfully identifies 69\% of the positive class instances.

These metrics provide an assessment of the performance of each model in terms of their accuracy, precision, and recall, revealing their ability to correctly classify instances and predict positive class labels.
